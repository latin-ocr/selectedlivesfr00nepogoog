Pauo 66. 1. Hannibalern: cf. p. 9, l. 1, with note.

2. quod: ordinarily we find the abl. with ds after uubit63
neuter pronouns in the accus. form the only exceptions.

3. ut . . . superirit: (for superaverit) a result clause where
an accus. and inf. would be more regular aiter verum est (G. 3 3² i ;
Η. 501, Ι, 2).

3. infitiandum: prejudiced Romans might easily do this ; later

several statues oi Hannibal were set up at Rome.

4. ceteris: we should expect ceteris (dat.); see on omnes,
p. 47, l. 7. In one tale Hannibal is represented as claiming only
third place, putting Alexander the Great and Pyrrhus before
himself.

6. antecedat: this is subjunct. by attraction from its depen-
dence on the inl. praestitisse (G. 342; H. 529, ΙΙ).

7. congressus est . . . discessit: sc. Hannibal for subject of
these. Hannibal did meet with one repulse at the hands oi
Marcellus when he attached Nola, a Campanian city, in ²¹4·
This was a mere trifle compared with the long list of Hannibal's
victories, but the Romans made a great deal ol it.

8. Quod: therefore.

9. domi: i.e., while Hannibal was in the field. He certainly
was not properly supported by his countrymen at home ; but the
fact that the Romans had a number of generals who were more
than a match for any Carthaginian leader other than Hannibal
had much to do with his failure.

11. virtitem: ability.
