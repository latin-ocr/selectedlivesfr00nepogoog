N OTES. 155

times follows its case.

3. Nihil: not at all ,· an emphatic utiu5 an adverbial accus.

3. pecunia: abl. of separation following opus (G. 243 e, but
see also footnote3 H. 414, IV).

contracted into gratis, which has been adopted into English.

6. Namque . . . ciritite: For J will not surrendcr (accipere,
lit. accept) my lovesor my country in exchangesor (pro) tlte wealtlz

governed by pro to exchange places, but seems to express the
idea naturally.

7. Tu: placed first with scornful emphasis, a man like you.

8. incognitum: trans. by a relative clause.

8. tur: gen. dependent on similem (G. 234d [2]; H. 391, ΙΙ. ·

not regarded as future though-tradam stands in the apodosis;

moriere virgis l you shall be floggcd to death) nisi mihi signum
diditur.
