186 NOTES.

10. iterum consulem: this should read (Gracchum) bis cou-
sulem and below Marcellum quintum consulem, for Gracchus was
killed after the expiration of his second, Marcellus during his
fifth consulship.

10. in Lucams: join with sustulit; see on per Liguras, p.69‚l.6.

10. absens: i.e., through his brother Mago.

13. Longum est: it would be tedicus, an expression of propriety
taking the indicative in Latin, but trans. as ir the subjunct.
(G. 311c).

14. ex quo: ut ex eo.

15. quamdiu . . . posuit: he was not defeated in Italy (if
we accept Nola). The rest oi the statement is absurd.

18. defensum: cf. deliberatum, p. r, l. 10.

18. revocatus: ²03·

19. P. Scipionem: i.e.‚ P. cornelius sulpio, to which the
agnomen Africanus was added after his defeat of Hannibal. He
conquered all Spain between 210 and 206. In 204 he went over
to Africa from Sicily and won a great battle near Utica, which
occasioned the recall of Hannibal.

22. impraesentiarum: an adverb equivalent to inpraesentia,
p. 8, l. 6; a colloquial expression probably from in praesentiit
rerum.

23. bellum componere: cf. bellum compositurum, p. 37, l. 20.

24. In conloquium convenit, etc. : a conference is agreed upon ;
on terms they did reat agree (lit. terms did nat meet).

25. Post id factum: after this took place, lit. aster tais deed.

26. Zamam: this was southwest of Carthage. Itis thought
that Naraggara, which lay fifty miles to the west of Zama, was
the scene of the battle ; the armies had encamped there prior to
the colloquy. Hadrumetum was not over one hundred miles
from Zama, one hundred and fifty from Naraggara; hence the
statement trecenta milia is an exaggeration.

Paper 71. abest ab Zama: abis used even with names of
towns when the distance from one place to another is stated.
8. acerrime occupatus : most actively engaged.
