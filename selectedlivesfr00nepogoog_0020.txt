In this comparison or balancing oI his countrymen with
foreigners we should naturally look for some disparage-
ment os the latter. But everywherein the portions of his
work that have corne down to us, we are forced to recog-
nize his fairness and impartiality. Even when a foreigner
gains his glory at the expense of Romans, as was true of
Hannibal, Nepos shows the highest admiration for his
exploits and in no way attempts to belittle his achieve·
ments

We find manymistakes and inaccuracies in his historical
statements hut in view of the great task he undertook‚ oI
his haste to finish the work hegun only late in life, and
of his being the first Roman historian to use foreign
authorities, this need not excite our surprise.
