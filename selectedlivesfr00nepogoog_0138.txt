NOTES. · 109

24. Tamen: in emphatic position; in spite of all these great
services.

25. timorem: see on extimescebam, p. 8, l. 11.

26. testularum suffragiis: the so-called ostracism. After the
banishment of Hippias, the Atheniens, in order to prevent the
rise of tyrants, hit upon a plan by which men whose intluence
and power seemed dangerous to liberty, might be exiled for a
term of years (originally ten, later fixed at five), with no loss of
property or honor; 6000 votes for this purpose must be cast to
bring it about, and, as they wrote the name of the obnoxious
citizen on potsherds (ὄστρακα = testulae), they named this action
ostracism, or the judgment of the potsherds.

Pane 16. 1. Argos: accus. plur. ; the place was the capital
of Argolis.

1. habitatum: a favorite way with Nepos of expressing pur·
pose after verbs oi motion is the supine in um; cf. deliberatum,
p. 1,l.10.

2. virtutes: probably services to Argos.

2. Lacedaemonii . . . miserunt, etc. .· 473 nc. Pausanias the
Spartan king had been convicted oi treasonable correspondence
with the Persian king. After his death letters were found in his
house which implicated Themistocles.

4. rege Perse: this differs from rege Persarum by implying
that the king is of the same blood as his subJects, which need
not be true ol the second phrase. .

4. proditionis: with damnatus est, not with crimine.

7. Argis: plural as in the case of many ancient towns, prob

ably originally adjectives, ag, the Argive villages; the Athenian
villages; then becoming Argi and Athenae. Cf. Argos, l. r.

8. iis: sibi would be more regular, but as Nepos has already
used se in this clause referring to Themistocles the subject of
animadvertisset, he could hardly avoid the change of pronoun.

10. Molossflm=1tlolosstirum They lived originally in the

interior of Epirus, but later possessed the whole country. Their
kings claimed descent from Neoptolemus, son of Achilles.
