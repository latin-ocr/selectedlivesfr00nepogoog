N OTES. 107

3. sibi . . . fore: they would loom sibl, dat. of possession.

4. quam infirmissimis: as weak os possible ; quam with super·
lative signifies the highest degree possible. (G. 93, b; H. 170,
2 [2]); cf. enus menime, p. 1, l. 3.

7. desierunt: from ‹lesine; the subject is Athenienses, which
should be in the text.

10. ut (reliqui legeth exirent: depends on praecepit below.

ro. tuende: dat. of purpose; satis alti tuende: high enough
for defense.

12. opus facerent: these words continue his instructions and
depend on praecepit. ’

12. neque: for neve=et ne.

16. sacellis: a diminutive from sacrum (cf castellum from
castrum); see group sno, snc-; these were small enclosed bits
ol ground consecrated to a divinity; they contained an altar, but
were not rooied over.

16. pensterent: oi course not to be taken literally; but even

then it implies an exaggeration ot the statement of Thucydides,
who says that the walls contained ‘⁴ many columns too taken from
sepulchres.'’ Consult Grote, Part II, chap. xliv.

18. magistretiis: nominally two kings having a council of 28
old men called the Gerusia‚ stood at the head of the Spartan
state, but a board of five officers called Ephors, exercised over-
sight over everything, having power to accuse and arrest even the
kings. Naturally the Ephors are meant here.

18. qnam longissime: see on quam infirmissimis, p. 14, l. 4.

20. conlegis: Aristides and Abronichus.

23. mimitibnis: i.e., the fortification was nearly complete.

24. penes qubs: in whose hands.

25. imperium: properly this means the command in war,
which was the prerogative of the kings and was seldom intertered
with by the ephors; hence unsuitable here. The proper word
would be potestis.

Pone 15. 1. quere aequum esse = ob eamque causam
aequum esse: this depends on contendit, and is parallel with esse
teum
