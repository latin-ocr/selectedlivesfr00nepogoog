126 NOTES.

ὀστρακισμόνς quod refers to the whole idea contained in the ex· 1

pression testarum suffragiis, hence the neuter.

5. exsilio: the Spartans in serious plight owing to a rising
of the Helots, sent to Athens for help. Cimon induced the
Athenians to send troops, butas the Spartans, becoming sus-
picious of them, sent the men back, the people visited their in-
dignation upon Cimon, accusing him of being opposed to the
interests of the people and a sympathizer with Sparta. Probably

the reasons given in Milt. 8, r, in the case of the father, apply ,

here also in the case of the son.

5. celerius: not strictly true, as Cimon wished to rejoin his
countrymen at the battle of Tanagra (see below), but was not
allowed to do so.

6. paenituit: impersonal as always; followed by accus. and

eu.
g 7. bellumque Lacedaemonii: the schemes of Pericles for ex·
tending Athenian sway over upper Greece received a check in the
defeat of the Athenians at'Tanagra in Boeotia (458) by a Spartan

force ; after the victory the Spartans returned to Peloponnesus.

1ο. Post: separated from quarn by tmesis; thus frequently
priusquam, antequam always translate as one word at the point
where quam comes in the text.

ιο. expulsus erat: the perfect indicative usually follows post·
quam; but whenever a definite amount of time is given, the plu·
perfect is used. Cimon was recalled in 457 ; the five years’ peace
was not arranged till 451.

11. hospitio: almost all Greek states had their guest-friend·
ships. The socalled πρόξενοι, hospites performed a duty some·
what similar to that of our modern consuls; but this difference
is to be noted z the American consul at Liverpool ag. is an Ameri-
can citizen who takes up his residence there when appointed; the
Spartan representative at Athens was an Athenian. He, how-
ever, was expected to help and befriend any Lacedaemonian who
came to Athens. See on hospitium, p. 16, l. 11.

13. sua sponte: tle. not sent officially; cf. the same words
in n. 22‚l. 5.
