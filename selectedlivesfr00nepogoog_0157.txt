piece, which was oval or round.

‘to invite to a feast!

9. unde: iae. ut inde.

ro. extulit: justas we often in English speak of a person as

10. sd gerendo: evidently Nepos meant to continue with a
principal verb of which Cimon would be the subject, but changed
the form into est mirandum.

11. si: aiter miror, si is often best translated that.

11. secura: this of course applies to Cimon himself, acerba to
his friends.
