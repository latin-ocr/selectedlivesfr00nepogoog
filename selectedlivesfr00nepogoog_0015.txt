recognition, the present edition has been limited‘ to nine
of the “Lives‚'' selected with special reference to their
historical value. In the biographies of Miltiades, Themis-
tocles, Cimon, and Alcibiades, we get glimpses oi Athens
and Athenian life and spirit in the most interesting period
ot the development of the state. In those of Pausanias
and Agesilaus, Nepos shows us something ot the peculiar 3
Spartan government‚ and draws a contrast between the l
characters ol two of the most famous Spartan lainga. In
the story of Pelopidas and Epaminondas we discover how
it was that Thebes was enabled to secure a prominent
place among'the peoples of Greece. Lastly the story of
Hannibal, dealing with his vow, his hatred 'ot Rome,
his marvelous ability as a general, the lear with which
he inspired the Romans, is preeminently worthy to be
included in any selection of representative lives from
Nepos. ,

The text is, with a lew minor alterations, that of Halm; l
the orthography is made unitorm with that oi the other
books in this series. In response to many requests the
quantity of long vowels has been indicated throughout the ζ
book. In determining quantities, and also in matters of
etymology, Lewis' Elementary Dictionary has been lor the ’
most part, though not invariably‚ followed.

The synonyms placed at the foot oi each page of text, l
and the word-groups printed just before the vocabulary‚
will, it is hoped‚ beot service in enlarging the pupil's l
vocabulary and training him in his earliest reading to
cultivate the power of associating words of like origin.
